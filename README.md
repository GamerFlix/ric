# Reflect, Inspect, Correct

A module for FounryVTT to provide a user interface to allow reflecting on the state of invalid Documents, inspect the issue in detail, and ultimately correct it by resolving the issue or deleting the Document.

Aswell as manual recovery showing the current invalid values

Do note that manual recovery is currently unsupported for values within Arrays and Documents with a custom type offer no room for recovery, only deletion.
